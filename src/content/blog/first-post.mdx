## Hi, I'm Leo Wang

This is the first blog on this brand-new, Astro-powered and blazingly-fast personal website.

### What will I use the website for?

It will be mainly used as a intro website for myself, a place to put down my thoughts as blog posts, and a place to showcase some of my projects.

### What am I working on recently?

I'm building a new task managing platform with react and supabase, it will be super cool.
